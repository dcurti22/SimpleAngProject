  "readme": "Simple Static\n==============\nSimple Static is a tiny web server for testing static web pages. It is designed around testing and \ndeveloping single page web apps, like with backbone, ember, angular etc. It handles mime-types, \nincludes, etc.  It doesn't have any required config settings.  Just install it, and run it. It \nserves files out of the directory it is running in, and any files and folders that are included \nunderneath.\n\nInstall\n-------\nSimple Static runs as as executable, so installing with -g is the preferred method:\n`npm install -g simple-static`\n\nRun\n---\nRun simple-static from whatever directory you are in, and it will serve files from that directory as the root. `simple-static`. simple-static is now serving files from the localdirectory on port 3333: http://localhost:3333/\n\nLicense\n--------\nCopyright (c) 2013 Nik Martin\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nThe Software shall be used for Good, not Evil.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
